we have completed the .l file (Lexical Analyzer/Scanner)
The .l file scans the C source code character by character and breaks it into meaningful pieces called tokens. It uses pattern matching (regular expressions) to identify keywords (like int, if), operators (+, =), identifiers (variable names), and numbers. Each time it finds a token, it logs it to the output file and sends it to the parser. we may need to recheck the regular expressions to ensure it handles all cases. 

we also completed .y file (Syntax Analyzer/Parser)
This file receives tokens from the .l file and checks if they follow correct  grammar rules. When tokens match a grammar rule (like "variable declaration"), it logs which rule matched along with the corresponding code segment. If the syntax is wrong, it detects errors.
